# We-Rate-Dogs-Twitter-Archive
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous
comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student
Matt Nelson, and has received international media attention both for its
popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when
it was suspended by Twitter for breaking these aforementioned laws.
